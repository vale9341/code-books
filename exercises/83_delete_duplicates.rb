# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @return {ListNode}
